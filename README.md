Tennis Together- 
Mission: Connecting teen players locally. 
(iOS App)
We want to create an app geared towards young tennis players where they can find players of similar levels, develop relationships, and improve their skill
It's a more casual and free way to find people to play tennis with, especially those who donâ€™t belong to a club or gym.
Age range: 10-18
People could find other players through the app who are in similar locations and similar skill levels. They could contact each other through the app and schedule a meet up at a designated court.
Find courts (outdoor)
Find players
Chat with players to schedule meet ups
Profile: city you live in, general skill level (UTR, USTA), age, picture
Techniques: Google maps API key
Websites- Bubble io/Make.com/Rapid APIs



What we need help on: 
---Trying to figure out how to integrate google maps apis and the ui for it on XCode. 
---The exact process of how the app is going to launch on the app store. 
---Going more in depth with swift & swift ui coding languages.
