Tennis Together- 
Mission: Connecting teen players locally. 
(iOS App)
We want to create an app geared towards young tennis players where they can find players of similar levels, develop relationships, and improve their skill
It's a more casual and free way to find people to play tennis with, especially those who donâ€™t belong to a club or gym.
Age range: 10-18
People could find other players through the app who are in similar locations and similar skill levels. They could contact each other through the app and schedule a meet up at a designated court.
